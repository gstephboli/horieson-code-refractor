# Horieson Code Refractor

This project was created to enhance my skills as a full stack web developer in the languages of HTMl and CSS with the knowledge that I have 
acquired thus far. The project had a pre-established HTML and CSS code provided. Upon opening and starting the process of changing the <div> 
into semantic elements instead, I also realized that I would need to consistently check my CSS and the webpage itself to see if my changes were
going to change the webpage. The first issue I ran into was attempting to change the hyperlinks in the header to a <nav>. I looked up on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) and could not find a proper solution. I attempted to play with the CSS of the "header" class but nothing I did allowed for the proper spacing 
and float right placement that I needed. This was the only <div> I left in the HTML. The rest of the HTML changes were straightforward and allowed for a clear understanding
of the layout of the webpage without needing to look at it. Due to this being one of my first projects, I had doubts about my alt tag descriptions but felt that the 
descriptions allowed for a clear view of the image without going into too many details of what all was in the image. One of my final pushes to GitHub was the background image. In the HTML there is no <a> for the background image and the CSS has all the details of how to position the image. I struggled deciding what to do with this because I felt that the image should be an <a> and that be accompanied by an alt tag. I decided that to properly follow ADA compliances I would make this into an <a> and make an alt tag to follow a safe protocol. If Horieson would to be a client of mine any safety and legal protocol to protect my client would be followed and this seemed like one of those instances to do so. 

In the CSS file, my biggest issue was again with the hyperlinks in the header but since I decided to leave it as a <div> , I did not worry about changing it. Otherwise, I consolidated repetitive code. Under the "content" class, I combined the class of .search-engine-optimization , .social-media-marketing but changed the #online-reputation-management into an ID. I did this because in the main content, it was the section that had an image to the right and therefore I wanted to be able to make that differentiation through the code and allow for someone else who would edit it so read that this section was different within the main content. I also brought the main content above the aside content. This also allows for clearer reading of the HTMl, CSS and webpage in unison. The only head tag that is not in sequential order is the footer h2, I did this again to make the flow of the CSS in unison with the HTML. 

This project allowed me to really implement the concepts that we have learned in class so far. As I am learning to do these things on my own, being able to see the problem and how to fix it, as well as be able to answer questions from my fellow classmates has just solidified more of my understanding and created a base that I feel is sturdy to continue.
